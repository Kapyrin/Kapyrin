# Vladimir Kapyrin

## Java developer

### Profile:

I am a Java junior developer. During my 100% hands-on training to write code; I solved more than 1000 algorithmic problems of varying complexity, and also completed many real projects. Some of them came with prompts, while others were completely self-paced with strict deadlines. All this required enormous effort and work from me to achieve the final result. The final project was especially interesting and useful, which was as close as possible to real work tasks: an existing unfinished project with specific tasks assigned.
